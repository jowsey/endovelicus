# Endovelicus Scripts

This is an archive of the scripts used for my 2D RTS game Endovelicus.

Some highlights:

- [Unit.cs](/Scripts/AI/Unit.cs) - main AI unit handler
- [MapManager.cs](/Scripts/Core/MapManager.cs) - procedural map generator

Endovelicus was one of my first Unity/C# projects. Code quality will reflect as much.

Regardless, I'm very happy with the progress I made. Code left here is old, used at your own risk, etc.
